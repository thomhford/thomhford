  Hi!  Thanks for coming to check out my work.  I've really enjoyed being able to put all of this together.

I have an exciting list of projects that you can check out.  Feel free to take a look.  I'm doing my best to include writeups for each project in the project folder, though I have not yet completed this.  Please feel free to peruse the code and reach out to me if you have any questions.
